# Initially made for a Jupyter notebook, hence all this manipulations with
# dataframes
# Probable could just write a list directly into xlsx

# Rewrite for using in BS only, scratch all of the direct parcer operations

# check if proxies only with https support used

# calculate stats according to schedule
# put ip_addresses into a file, check the proxies every 30 min
# SORT clean names by owned (another page)

# !!!
# check if SEASON_IN_PROGRESS
# check START_FROM, it could differ every time even if SEASON_IN_PROGRESS
# !!!

# You don't need too use Spot and Add columns in preseason
